# Data-Driven Insights for Tutor and Student Performance Optimization

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing the performance of tutors and students across multiple metrics, using data collected from educational sessions over varying time periods. The goal is to improve the quality of tutoring sessions and student outcomes by providing actionable insights based on attendance, engagement, and learning metrics.

## Objective

The primary objective of this analysis is to uncover key performance trends in both tutors and students, identify areas for improvement, and recommend strategies to enhance overall learning experiences. The project delves into understanding the relationships between attendance, session quality, and the resulting academic growth.

## Key Features of the Analysis

### 1. Scholar Metrics Analysis
- **Confidence**: Measuring growth in scholar confidence over time and identifying key patterns in areas where confidence has decreased.
- **Enjoyment**: Tracking scholar enjoyment in sessions, identifying what learning methods increase engagement.
- **Learning**: Analyzing academic growth of scholars, determining the effectiveness of different tutoring methods.
- **Session Quality**: Evaluating the quality of educational sessions from the perspective of students to determine satisfaction trends.

### 2. Tutor Metrics Analysis
- **Engagement**: Tracking tutor engagement over time and examining its impact on scholar outcomes.
- **Learning**: Monitoring the progress of tutors' instructional skills and how this affects their performance.
- **Session Quality**: Evaluating session quality from the tutors' perspective, highlighting their contributions to improving student outcomes.

### 3. Attendance, Incomplete, and Missed Sessions
- **Scholar Attendance**: Analyzing the impact of student attendance on their academic growth, enjoyment, and session satisfaction.
- **Tutor Attendance**: Tracking the attendance of tutors and analyzing its effects on their engagement, learning, and session effectiveness.
- **Incomplete Sessions**: Investigating incomplete sessions for both scholars and tutors, and understanding the factors leading to incomplete attendance.
- **Missed Sessions**: Studying the effect of missed sessions on overall performance for both scholars and tutors.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The project required extensive data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the data was ready for meaningful analysis. This included:

1. **Data Consolidation**: Merging data from multiple sources and formats into a unified dataset to allow for comprehensive analysis across various metrics such as attendance, engagement, confidence, and learning.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing data, particularly in attendance and feedback metrics, was carefully managed. Rows with incomplete or partially missing information were either imputed using statistical methods (mean/mode imputation) or excluded from the analysis if they could not be reasonably estimated.
3. **Standardization**: Various columns such as session ratings, attendance percentages, and qualitative feedback were standardized to allow for uniform comparison across multiple groups (e.g., students, tutors, districts, and schools).
4. **Outlier Detection**: Outliers were detected and analyzed to determine their impact on the data. In cases where outliers represented true extremes (e.g., extremely low attendance rates), they were retained for further investigation, but erroneous outliers (such as data entry errors) were corrected or removed.
5. **Data Transformation**: In certain cases, qualitative feedback was transformed into quantifiable scores using sentiment analysis techniques. For example, session feedback was categorized into numerical scales to facilitate comparison and trend analysis.

## Analysis Process

The analysis followed a structured, **funnel approach**:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: This initial stage involved a high-level comparison of all scholars and tutors, identifying potential growth metrics and areas of concern. Key insights from the EDA included correlations between attendance, session quality, and performance metrics like learning and engagement.
   
2. **Comparative Analysis**: Over varying time periods, comparative analysis was conducted for both scholars and tutors across key metrics (confidence, enjoyment, learning, and session quality). This provided insights into how performance and satisfaction have evolved over time.
   
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Relationships between variables such as attendance rates and academic growth, incomplete sessions and performance metrics were explored. This helped to uncover statistically significant trends and correlations, which informed the actionable recommendations.
   
4. **Performance Breakdown by Groups**: Scholars and tutors were categorized by race, district, school, and grade, allowing for more granular insights into how different demographics and geographic factors affect performance.

5. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   To test specific relationships within the dataset, hypothesis testing was performed, including t-tests and regression analysis. Key findings include:
   Confidence and Attendance: Scholars with higher confidence ratings attended significantly more sessions.
   Enjoyment and Attendance: Higher enjoyment scores led to increased attendance.
   Missed Sessions and Learning: No significant relationship was found between missed sessions and learning, suggesting that other factors influence scholar learning outcomes.

6.**Machine Learning Models** :
   Two primary machine learning models were developed to predict and cluster attendance-related behaviors:

   Cluster Analysis: Scholars were grouped into three clusters based on their attendance patterns, missed sessions, and late arrivals. Insights gained from this analysis helped to identify scholars    who needed targeted interventions.
   Attendance Prediction Model: A Random Forest model was built to predict low attendance, achieving an accuracy of 77.7%. This model highlights key factors like missed sessions and incomplete         attendance as important predictors of low attendance. 


## Tools and Technologies
